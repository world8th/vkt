# VKt

Vulkan API Tools C++ helping library. The most long-live library ever (more than 2 years)... 

## Deprecation...

The library is becoming obsolete today. Despite all my clean-ups and reorganizations, too much junk has accumulated in the code. Therefore, I decide to create a new library for the Vulkan API, based on C ++ 20 and C17.

- [Tommy](https://github.com/helixd2s/Tommy) - new project of GPGPU compute, based on Vulkan API 1.2, for C++20 and C17...
